## Overview
Defense in depth is a strategy that integrates multiple layers of security measures to protect an organization's assets. When only one control is implemented in a given area, there is only one control that attackers need to exploit to gain access to their target. Defense in depth hardens the organization's security and protects against malicious threats by requiring multiple physical, technical, and administrative controls to be deployed. 

## Physical Controls  
Physical controls refer to the measures implemented to protect the organization's physical assets: physical infrastructure and hardware, access devices, documents containing sensitive information, and all other tangible items that could be considered valuable to the organization or an attacker.

**Examples**
- CCTV
- Access control vestibules
- Interlocking door systems
- Alarm systems
- Locked server racks and wiring closets 


## Technical Controls
Controls that are integrated using technology are referred to as technical controls. These controls rely on hardware, software, automation, system configurations, and cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, information, accounts, network segments, devices, and related assets. Multi-layered defenses at this domain are implemented at the system, hardware, network, and software levels.

**Examples**
- Network and host firewalls
- Detection and prevention systems
- VPNs
- Data encryption
- MFA
- Antivirus software

**Redundancy** <br>
Redundancy is another aspect of DID, using technical controls such as load balancers, redundant switches and routers, and virtual machine failover to provide alternate paths or resources, eliminating single points of failure. This helps prevent downtime and service interruptions. 

## Administrative Controls
While technical and physical controls deal with the actual implementation of security policy, administrative controls are concerned with people, processes, and policies that shape security. In this domain, defense in depth is achieved by covering multiple areas. 

**Examples**
- Standardizing security practices
- Defining roles and expectations
- Describing overall principles that guide the implementation of physical and technical controls
- Security awareness training
